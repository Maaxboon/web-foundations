"""
5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests . Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test . Your code should look something like this:
 car = 'subaru'
 print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
 print(car == 'subaru')
 print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
 print(car == 'audi')
 •	Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False .
 •	Create at least 10 tests . Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 
5 tests evaluate to False .
