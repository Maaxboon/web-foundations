#  Changing, adding, and removing elements
# Modifying Elements in a List
"""
The syntax for modifying an element is similar to the syntax for accessing an element in a list. To change an element, use the name of the list followed by the index of the element you want to change, and then provide the new value you want that item to have.

# Initial list of motorcycles
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles) 

# changing the value of honda
motorcycles[0] = 'ducati'
print(motorcycles)
