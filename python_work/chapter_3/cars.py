# Sorting a List Permanently with the sort() Method
"""
Python’s sort() method makes it relatively easy to sort a list. Imagine we have a list of cars and want to change the order of the list to store them alphabetically. To keep the task simple, let’s assume that all the values in the list are lowercase.

cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
cars.sort()
print(cars)
